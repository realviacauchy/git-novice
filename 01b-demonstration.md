#Person 1#
So, here is a representation of a file in our coding project.

**draws square in top center**

And here are some of the contents of the file.

**draws circles inside square**

Don't stress too much about what these are. These are just representations of things in a file (or a project?).
This version of the file is our original.
In our terrible version control nightmare from before, we kept saving new versions of the file. 

**draws another square filled with circles on the next level, to the left**

And **sending** copies to other people to work with.

**PERSON 2 DRAWS another square filled with circles on the second level, to the right**


So, if I made a small change, like *this* one...

**substitutes one circle with another shape**

I would have a new version, or I would save over the old one, which, I might, ultimately regret.

But with git, we save the **change** that we made.

**draws arrow from first square to second with label of circle ---> square**

#Person Two#

Meanwhile I've been making my own, different changes to the file.

**replaces a different circle with a different shape**

And saving my own changes.

**draws arrow with label**

#Person 1#
While I make another change.

**draws another square on the third level followed by another substitution and another labelled arrow**

#AND WE'LL HAVE TO FINISH THIS LATER IM SO VERY TIRED.#
